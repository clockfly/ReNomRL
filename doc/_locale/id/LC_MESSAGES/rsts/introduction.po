"Due to Deep Learning, the technology to learn from large data set has "
"evolved exponentially and now, we are able to recognize certain objects "
"and increase translation accuracy, especially for image and voice "
"recognition purpose. There have even been reports that these models "
"outperform specialists in certain fields. However, when we look back, we "
"realize that humans can learn without input data. In machine learning, "
"there is a machine learning field called “Reinforcement Learning”, which "
"bases its algorithm on finding the optimal action using the intuitive "
"human behavior of trial and error."

"Reinforcement learning is a method where the agent learns the optimal "
"input scheme from rewards only. Applying pictures and sensor data to "
"reinforcement learning was a difficult task, due to the finite state the "
"algorithm can handle, but due to appliance of deep learning, more "
"difficult problems can be handled where problems use image or sensory "
"data."

"Recently, information about reinforcement learning on the internet has "
"increased, but without sufficient knowledge and enough experience of "
"applying to real world problems, research becomes time consuming, and "
"difficulty of applying reinforcement learning to real world problem "

"API that can help people understand this field more clearly."

#~ " .. Recent developing deep learning "
#~ "technology realizes extremely big improvement"
#~ " at recognition accuracy. .. However "
#~ "if you would create a recognition "
#~ "model for any business scene such "
#~ "as recognising damages of manufactured "
#~ "products, there are still many problems"
#~ " for earning high accuracy recognition "
#~ "model. .. For example, correcting "
#~ "training dataset, programming recognition "
#~ "model and train it, evaluating the "
#~ "model, and so on. .. Especially, "
#~ "even if deep learning era, it is"
#~ " required to tune up the hyper "
#~ "parameters of the recognition model. It"
