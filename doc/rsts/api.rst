API
===================================

This page is the API renferece for ReNomRL. The following index is structured based on the ReNomRL API. For algoritms based on continuous or discrete aciton space, check ``renom_rl.continuous`` or ``renom_rl.discrete``. For environment based class, check ``renom_rl.environ``. For functions such as animations or gamma reduction change, check ``renom_rl.utility``.
