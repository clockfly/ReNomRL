"The concept of ReNomRL is **blahblah**. .. Recent developing deep "
"learning technology realizes extremely big improvement at recognition "
"accuracy. .. However if you would create a recognition model for any "
"business scene such as recognising damages of manufactured products, "
"there are still many problems for earning high accuracy recognition "
"model. .. For example, correcting training dataset, programming "
"recognition model and train it, evaluating the model, and so on. .. "
"Especially, even if deep learning era, it is required to tune up the "
"hyper parameters of the recognition model. It requires many try and "
"errors. .. ReNomIMG allows you to build object detection model easily."
